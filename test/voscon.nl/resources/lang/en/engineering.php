							  development: from thinking along about the process, also known as concept-engineering, to
							  shaping it. With building arrangements, and layouts, from complete production lines to
							  details. Using SolidWorks\' 3D-software we are able to give shape to your complete project,
							  and build and deliver it with precision and an eye for detail. In addition, our approach
							  ensures that you\'ll have a good overview no matter how complex the project is. At the stage
							  of detail engineering, we do not limit ourselves to creating the optimal conditions for
							  construction or reconstruction. Euromet BV even accounts for future maintenance.',
